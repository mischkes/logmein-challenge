# The Challenge
Implement a simple shopping list service that allows a user to manage a list of items they
want to buy during their next time doing their groceries.

###Task Description
* Implement the shopping list as a REST service based on Java Spring Boot
* The service should allow to insert an item, change an item, delete an item, and get a
list of all items on the list
* Inserting an item should generate a unique ID for later reference
* The service does not offer a UI
* The shopping list items do not need to survive a service restart
* For simplicity: Do not bother about multi-user or authentication scenarios. For this
exercise the API does not need to be secured.
* Limit the scope of the functionality to the specification
* The project should build a WAR file, deployable on a web container.
* Feel free to use online references and resources. Add citations when lifting blocks of
code.
